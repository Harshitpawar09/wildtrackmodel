Problem and Solution Domain 
Problem Domain: 
Wildlife conservation plays a critical role in preserving biodiversity and maintaining ecological 
balance. One of the key tasks in wildlife research and monitoring is identifying the species 
present in a specific area. Traditionally, forest officials, trackers, and researchers rely on direct 
sightings or pugmark (footprint) analysis to identify animals. However, manual pugmark 
identification requires extensive experience and is prone to human error, especially in cases of 
partial or unclear prints. In dense forests, during the night, or in regions with low visibility, direct 
sightings are rare, making footprint analysis the only viable method. 
The limitations of manual analysis include: 
 Time-consuming identification process. 
 Dependency on human expertise. 
 Difficulty in maintaining large-scale monitoring operations. 
 Inaccuracy in case of distorted or incomplete prints. 
Solution Domain: 
The proposed solution is to create an AI-powered Wildlife Species Identifier that can 
automatically detect the animal species from an image of its footprint. This will be achieved 
using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), a type of deep learning model specialized in 
image recognition. The system will be trained on a dataset of wildlife footprints (both sourced 
online and self-captured using clay simulations) and will be capable of classifying them into 
species such as tiger, leopard, deer, elephant, etc. 
The application will be accessible via a simple web interface, allowing forest officials, 
researchers, and students to upload an image of a footprint and instantly receive the predicted 
species. This approach will: 
 Reduce dependency on expert trackers. 
 Enable fast and contactless monitoring. 
 Provide consistent and accurate results. 
 Support large-scale wildlife monitoring in forests and protected areas. 
By combining artificial intelligence with wildlife tracking, this project aims to modernize 
traditional conservation methods, making them faster, smarter, and more reliable.

Expected Outcome 
The expected outcome of this project is a fully functional AI-based application that can 
accurately identify animal species from their footprint images. The final system will: 
1. Accept an uploaded footprint image through a web interface. 
2. Process and analyze the image using a trained deep learning model. 
3. Display the predicted species with confidence score. 
4. Allow researchers and forest staff to use the tool without needing coding or AI expertise. 
Key Deliverables: 
 Trained CNN Model for footprint classification. 
 Web Application for easy access and usage. 
 Comprehensive Dataset of wildlife footprints. 
 Documentation & User Guide for understanding the system. 
Impact: 
This system will help wildlife researchers, forest departments, and conservationists in 
tracking animals more efficiently. It will also serve as an educational tool for students and 
enthusiasts learning about wildlife monitoring. By reducing manual workload and increasing 
accuracy, the project can contribute to better wildlife management and anti-poaching 
measures.
